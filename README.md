# mydotfiles

All my Dotfiles at one place.

## Xprofile

Will be loaded automatically by lightdm.

### dbus

On `VoidLinux` the dbus is not launched automatically and my cause some problems
(e.g. with flatpak).

### High DPI

On high dpi systems you need some additional config. Otherwise everything is tiny.

Checkout [the arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI)
for more info.
